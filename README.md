# Economics-Code
Various code that I make for economics classes.

PDF_Extractor
This is a script I wrote to extract key:value pairs from a pdf. The keys are easily configurable. This script probably saved me a bit of time. I used the data from this for my economics of sports analysis in SAS.

Example usage:
```sh
┌──(username㉿HOST)-[./PDF_Extractor]
└─$ python Data_Extractor.py
Enter the path to the PDF file: Examples/MLB.pdf

Done!
```


Reserves:
This is a simple script I made to automate calculations for fractional reserve banking.

It will output reserves, deposits, and loans for every iteration.
It will also output total money supply.
